# Journal of real-time reconstruction

This prject has been on and off with me for nearly 6 month, it been a truly crazy ride! In school or in internships, you know something is possible. But what happens 
when you know little about a filed, and your advisor, your teammates, even yourself questionning whether something is possible? Will you go on? Will you have the 
determination to get solve all the puzzels?

Well not to brage, I did carry on, build a system that no one thought was possible. Though this may look silly in a professional developer, I see this as my first attemp 
towards exploring unknown, and remind me that we are trouble maker, but we are even better trouble solver! 

Enjoy!
