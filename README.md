# Stories

Why a menial programmer needs to write stories?

For a programmer, either a developer or reasearcher, there will be momemnts that you conquer a problem through hardwork. But in my experience, limitted as they may be, those momemnts are composed of many many funny stories, either a stupid mistake, or a suuden understainding, or somply no problem at all! 

We often remember momemnts when we accomplish a task, but those interesing stories are left behind. However, I though those stories are important as well, they remaind us how to be a better programmer, or a better person, or simply to be better at living!

That why I started this reposity, want to rememeber those stories. And since I want to enjoy my life, my foucs will be how to tell funny stories!
